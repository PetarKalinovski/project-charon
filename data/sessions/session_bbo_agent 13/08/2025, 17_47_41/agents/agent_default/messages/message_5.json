Based on their journal, they enjoy meaningful video content (like Ezra Klein interviews) and intellectual material. They have various time slot options available: morning sessions (7:00-8:30 AM), evening sessions (1-6 hours depending on the day), and weekend blocks. They're looking for a comprehensive reading plan that will help them stick to the habit. Please provide book recommendations, reading strategies, and advice on how to structure different reading sessions throughout the week to maximize engagement and habit formation."
