I'll continue with text-only responses.\n\nSince you haven't answered about your book preferences or calendar scheduling yet, would you like me to:\n\n1. **Add the reading sessions to your calendar** with placeholder book titles?\n2. **Wait for you to choose** which books appeal to you most before scheduling?\n3. **Just start with one simple session** (like tonight's 6-8 PM slot) and build from there?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed with implementing your reading plan!"
