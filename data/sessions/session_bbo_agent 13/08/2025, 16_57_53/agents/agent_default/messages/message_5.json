Here's what you have coming up:\n\n**Today (Wednesday)** looks nice and light - just swimming at 8:00-9:00 PM, so you have plenty of time for that focused coding session you were planning (which I see from your journal you wanted to work on).\n\n**Tomorrow (Thursday)** is your big day with:\n- Anthropic interview from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM \n- Presentation prep from 3:00-5:00 PM\n- ML internship project presentation from 5:00-6:00 PM\n\n**Friday** is quite relaxed with just a passport renewal appointment from 1:00-2:00 PM.\n\nGiven what I know from your journal about working from the office today and planning that coding session, it looks like you have a good window to focus on development work before tomorrow's important interviews and presentation. \n\nWould you like help preparing for tomorrow's Anthropic interview, or do you want to focus on that coding session today while you have the clear schedule?"
