I saw Noah tweeted that he liked Dwarkesh.\n\n## 10:47:20 - Task\n- [ ] Watch YouTube video: Dario Amodei and Ezra Klein interview (about a year old)\n\n## 11:16:25\nCame to the office today seeking a change of scenery from working at home. Feeling uncertain about whether this was the right choice - worried it might not have been the best decision. Wanted to break up the routine of home-based work but having second thoughts about the effectiveness of this change.\n\n## 11:22:34\nA few nights ago stayed awake late and watched recent Ezra Klein video about Mahmoud Khalil and his illegal detention by the US government for months. Really loved this video - it resonated deeply. Even wrote about it in my Obsidian notes. The video helped process feelings of existential dread that come up when hearing about injustices like this. Found it meaningful and cathartic to engage with this content.\n\n## 12:40:46\nUser planning 4-5 hour focused coding session to implement file writing tool for Charon project. Task Agent provided detailed implementation plan with phases and 9-14 hour total estimate. User wants to unwind after coding session - Home Agent suggested gentle intellectual transitions (Asianometry), cozy TV (The Bear), literary decompression (The Midnight Library), or queued video content. User seems to appreciate meaningful video content and has been working from office for change of scenery. Good balance of work planning + leisure preparation.\n"
