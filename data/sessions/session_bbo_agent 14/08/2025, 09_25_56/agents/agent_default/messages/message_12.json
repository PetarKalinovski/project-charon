Your Charon file writing tool development sessions are now blocked out with the perfect balance of focused coding time followed by relaxing reading sessions.\n\nThe schedule gives you:\n- **6.5 hours total** for Charon development (4 hours Saturday + 2.5 hours Sunday)\n- **2 hours total** for \"The Midnight Library\" reading as immediate relaxation after each coding session\n- **Seamless transitions** - no gaps between work and relaxation time\n\nThis is an excellent approach to weekend productivity - intensive focused work blocks followed immediately by enjoyable, restful activities. You'll be able to make significant progress on your Charon project while ensuring you have built-in downtime to recharge! ðŸš€ðŸ“š\n"
