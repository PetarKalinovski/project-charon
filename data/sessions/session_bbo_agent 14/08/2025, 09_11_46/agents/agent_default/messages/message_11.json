Tackle the file writing implementation when you're mentally fresh, then unwind with Abbott Elementary tonight. The contrast between focused coding and lighthearted comedy should give your brain the perfect transition from work mode to relaxation.\n\nWould you like me to help you start with any specific part of the implementation, or shall we schedule your relaxation time first?"
