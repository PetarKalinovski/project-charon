Check out the Noah Smith and Dwarkesh Patel collaboration - it's a YouTube video, around 1h. I saw Noah tweeted that he liked Dwarkesh.

Came to the office today seeking a change of scenery from working at home. Feeling uncertain about whether this was the right choice - worried it might not have been the best decision. Wanted to break up the routine of home-based work but having second thoughts about the effectiveness of this change.

A few nights ago stayed awake late and watched recent Ezra Klein video about Mahmoud Khalil and his illegal detention by the US government for months. Really loved this video - it resonated deeply. Even wrote about it in my Obsidian notes. The video helped process feelings of existential dread that come up when hearing about injustices like this. Found it meaningful and cathartic to engage with this content.

User wants comprehensive weekly reading plan after slacking on reading habit. Currently has 9-5 work schedule with good availability for morning (7:00-8:30 AM) and evening sessions. Schedule shows: busy Wednesday (swimming 8-9 PM), heavy Thursday (interview/presentation), light Friday (passport appointment 1-2 PM), completely free weekend and Monday-Tuesday.

Recommended structure:
- Morning sessions (7:00-8:30 AM): Challenging non-fiction on M/W/F  
- Evening sessions: Fiction/lighter material for unwinding
- Weekend: 3-4 hour deep dive sessions

Book sequence starting with Atomic Habits (morning) and engaging fiction (evening). User shows intellectual curiosity similar to Ezra Klein content they enjoy. Key strategy: never skip two days in a row, start with 15 minutes if needed, always have 3 books ready.

Planning to schedule specific calendar blocks and help choose first book to start habit formation.

## 17:58:15 - Task
- [ ] Reading habit successfully launched - replaced "Atomic Hearts" confusion with proper book selection: "Thinking, Fast and Slow" (mornings) + "The Midnight Library" (evenings). Calendar blocks scheduled for optimal times.
